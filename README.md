## iSharing

iSharing is an Android application that can be used for incentivized internet sharing, and is initially targeted for the Mbare community. The goal of the project is to connect the unconnected, as part of the[Internet Society vision]([https://www.internetsociety.org/grants/chapterthon/2019/](https://www.internetsociety.org/grants/chapterthon/2019/)).
    
## Project  
 
This project utilises [Hype](https://hypelabs.io/?r=10), which is an SDK for cross-platform peer-to-peer communication with mesh networking. Hype works even without Internet access, connecting devices via other communication channels such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi direct, and Infrastructural Wi-Fi.    

The Community Network, developed using the Hype Open Protocol, enables iMbare to share its excess fixed-plan Internet with locals whilst getting incentivized through HOP tokens. iMbareâ€™s offline-first CN is implemented as a Content Distribution Network, created from a cluster of Raspberry Pis.
